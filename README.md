CSC309-Assignment1
==================
@ Copyright Frank Tian & Aaron Li
This project is the first assignment for CSC309 at University of Toronto during Summer 2013. This project requires 
us to create a paint application with HTML5 canvas. We are using the KineticJS library.

The basic function of this application is to allow user to create shapes such a rectangle, a circle and a line, allow 
user to select the fill colour and outline colour as well as the outline width. It also allow user to copy the shape 
and resize it.
