CSC309-Assignment1
==================
@ Copyright Frank Tian & Aaron Li
This project is the first assignment for CSC309 at University of Toronto during Summer 2013. This project requires 
us to create a paint application with HTML5 canvas. We are using the KineticJS library.

The basic function of this application is to allow user to create shapes such a rectangle, a circle and a line, allow 
user to select the fill colour and outline colour as well as the outline width. It also allow user to copy the shape 
and resize it.

The description of this project is as follows:
Develop a drawing application that provides the following functionality:

It lets users create drawings using a combination of straight lines, circles and rectangles. For example, to draw a new straight line a user selects this shape type from some menu or toolbar, and clicks on the desired starting position on the canvas. The user then drags the mouse to the desired end position.
Lets users set the following graphic properties to be used for drawing new shapes: outline color, fill color, outline width.
Lets users select a previously drawn shape and perform an actions on it. For simplicity, when a shape is selected and actioned-upon, it becomes the top-most shape (i.e., it will have the highest z-index). Your application should support the following actions:
Erase the shape.
Move the shape to a new position on the canvas.
Resize the shape.
Change the shape's color, fill, and outline width.
Copy and paste.
Clear the canvas.

And I would like thank my girl friend, Roujia Li, of contributing to this project. She gave us a lot of advices on styling
the format of our web page so that to make it much more user-friendly. And she took the responsibiity of CSS sheet
